## Grasshopper Front-end
_____________

### What is it?
Grasshopper is a simple message board with a RAILS API back-end and a Front-end written in Angular JS.

Here you will find the Grasshopper front-end, which I made as an example and exploration of a RESTful API being consumed by an AngularJS front-end.

Find the RAILs API counterpart here:

### how to make use of it?

I've packaged the front-end here on top of a Node.js server to suit my own deployment needs and to demonstrate it's independance from the RAILS app that serves up the Grasshopper JSON.  See a live example here:
http://grassy.shufflebox.org

The front-end app can be run from anywhere though. Assuming you have the node dependancies installed, just clone to your desktop and run ```node index.js```  .
